# Open Climate Fix

Open Climate Fix is a new non-profit research and development lab, totally focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions as rapidly as possible. Every part of the organisation is designed to maximise climate impact, such as our open and collaborative approach, our rapid prototyping, and our attention on finding scalable & practical solutions.

By using an open-source approach, we can draw upon a much larger pool of expertise than any individual company, so combining existing islands of knowledge and accelerating progress.

Our approach will be to search for ML (Machine Learning) problems where, if we solve a well-defined ML task, then there is likely to be a large climate impact. Then, for each of these challenges, we will:

* <b>Collate & release data</b>, and write software tools to make it super-easy for people to consume this data.
* <b>Run a collaborative “global research project”</b> where everyone from 16-year-olds to PhD students to corporate research labs can help solve the ML task (and, over the last 6 weeks, we have received over 300 emails from people who’d love to get involved).
* <b>Help to put good solutions into production</b>, once the community has developed them, so we can be reducing emissions ASAP.
